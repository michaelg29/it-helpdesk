## Internet browsers
### Downloading files
Downloading files happens in two ways: clicking on links, or saving files directly. Sites offer files for download via a hyperlink, like so: <a download href="/assets/common/gh.png">Download picture</a>. You can also tell the browser to save the current displayed file by pressing **`Ctrl+S`** on Windows or **`Cmd+S`** on Mac. Sometimes the browser will automatically download it to your user's local downloads directory. This can be found by opening your file explorer and clicking on the Downloads option on the lefthand side. Other times, the browser will ask you to specify where to download a file through a file explorer. Make sure to remember this spot when you want to access the file. Again, your local downloads folder is a good place to download files to because it is easy to find. A sample download process is shown below using Firefox. With Firefox, the popup appears as shown in (2), this will often include a button to open the download location. All browsers offer this feature, but the popup may not always be immediate, in which case you will have to find the downloads location in the browser.
